## Goal of the game
Be the richest player when the turn count is up. The total wealth of the player is the sum of the value of all his 
properties, plus his money minus his debts.


What you’ll need


- One Pen and paper for each player and one for the values table
- 60 brown squares. The lands
- 60 green squares. The crops
- 30 yellow squares. The gold mines
- 5 blue squares. Lakes
- 5 gray squares. Mountains
- Something to mark the ownership of a square, ie: beans


## Starting the game


Put all squares, except the green ones, on the table facing down on a 10x10 grid.   
Each player must choose a square to be his starting square. The square must not be connected to any other 
player starting square.  
If the player chooses a mountain, a lake or a gold mine he must choose another square.  
The tile is converted to a crop right after the player chooses it.  

After all players have chosen their starting squares turn all squares up. The player will have to buy 
the chosen square, so if a player chose a gold mine or land, he will have to pay the starting price.   


The table of values must be visible to all players, and will contain:
- The land price
- The seed price - An unseeded land doesn’t make profit
- The seeded land profit - a crop
- The gold mine price
- The gold mine profit 
- The distance tax -   that is the tax when you buy any land. The tax is cumulative, so a land that 
is 2 squares of distance (manhattan distance) from your land costs the normal price plus 2x tax. ie: 
if the tax is 4c it will cost you 8c . The tax is also applied on player donations. If a player has no lands he doesn't need to pay donation taxes.  
- The lake multiplier  - All lands connected to a lake (vertically or horizontally, diagnals don't count) 
will have its value and profit multiplied by this factor - multipliers are cumulative, 
if a land is connected to two lakes and the multiplier is 2x, the land will have a 4x multiplier
- The mountain multiplier - All lands connected to a mountain (vertically or horizontally, diagnals 
don't count) will have its value and profit multiplied by this factor - multipliers are 
cumulative even between lakes and mountains
- The loan multiplier - This is the value multiplied to your debt at the end of your play.

Also, must be visible to all players:
- The shuffled “Events” deck
- The shuffled “Paid actions” deck

No value can go below one.

## A players turn
The first thing is to collect the profit. This must be done before any 
other action. The subsequent
actions can be performed in any order . At the end of the players turn, his debt will be multiplied by 
the loan multiplier.
The profit for each square is the value from the value table. 
After collecting the profit the player can:
**Pay his debt** - If the player has a debt, he can pay it any time.  

**Make a loan** - The loan will be granted only if the total debt plus the loan does not exceed 20c.  

**Buy/sell land** - Note that the player must pay the distance tax. 
On a player to player negotiation, who pays the tax is up to the players to decide. An empty land costs 
the price on the value table, 
but an owned land can be sold at any price the owner wishes. For example, a player may charge a higher 
price for a land with a double profit multiplier.  

**Seed a land** - Brown squares are unseeded land, to make a profit the player must seed his land, turning 
it on a crop. When a land is seeded a green square replaces the brown one.  

**Buy cattle** - A player can convert a crop square on a cattle square by buying cattle. The square ceases to 
be a crop, its profit is now the value in the “Cattle profit” on the value table.  

**Donation** - A player owns his money, and can use it the way he chooses, including donating it to other 
players to gain political support. Any donation must pay the 
distance tax, being the distance the smaller distance between any of the player squares. A player with no lands doesn't pay donation taxes to donate or receive money. Note that it’s a donation, so if the other accepts the donation this doesn’t mean he will respect the agreement.  

**Buy acion card** - A player can buy and use an action card, he can buy and use as many cards as he wants, 
limited by the deck size.  the action card returns to the deck and it is reshuffled.

At the end of the player turn after paying his debts, any debt left with the bank is multiplied by the loan 
multiplier and the turn goes to the next player to the right, and so on until it’s the first player turn again.

## Events

Every time that is the first player turn (except the first time), three event cards are drawn from the 
events deck, facing down. The first card is then turned up, 
read and after all players took action the event is triggered or not. Then the next event card is turned 
up and so on until all events are done. 
The events are removed from the deck.    

There are two types of event, the “vote to avoid” and the “pay to avoid”.
- Vote to avoid - If the majority of the players vote against this event, it will not be triggered. On the 
voting phase, the player can donate money to another 
player to change his vote, obeying the distance tax. In case of draw the event is triggered. After the 
voting the event is triggered immediately.
- Pay to avoid - If the value of this event is paid, it will not be triggered. Players can make loans to 
pay to avoid the event. Each event have different payment rules.

### Pay to avoid:
- Increase loan multiplier - Pay 10c to avoid this. - 3 cards

converted back to crops but are still owned by the player. - Pay 20c to avoid this. - 3 cards

### Action cards
- Steal 3 gold mines from any player

The game proceeds until the turn count reaches a given number (20 for example, decided before game begun), then the player with the biggest wealth, or the smallest debt, wins!
