Goal of the game
Be the richest player when the time is up. The total wealth of the player is the sum of the value of all his properties, plus his money minus his debts.
What you’ll need
- An alarm clock
- One Pen and paper for each player and one for the values table
- 60 brown squares. The lands
- 60 green squares. The crops
- 30 yellow squares. The gold mines
- 5 blue squares. Lakes
- 5 gray squares. Mountains
- Something to mark the ownership of a square, ie: beans
Starting the game
Put all squares, except the green ones, on the table facing down on a 10x10 grid.   
Each player must choose a square to be his starting square. The square must not be connected to any other player starting square.
After all players have chosen their starting squares turn all squares up. The player will have to buy the chosen square, so if a player chose a gold mine or land, he will have to pay the starting price. If the player chooses a colored square he must choose another square touching his square.

The table of values must be visible to all players, and will contain:
- The land price
- The seed price - An unseeded land doesn’t make profit
- The seeded land profit - a crop
- The gold mine price
- The gold mine profit 
- The distance tax -   that is the tax when you buy a land that is not connected to any land you own. The tax is cumulative, so a land that is 2 squares of distance (manhattan distance) from your land costs the normal price plus 2x tax. ie: if the tax is 4c it will cost you 8c
- The lake multiplier  - All lands connected to a lake will have its value and profit multiplied by this factor - multipliers are cumulative, if a land is connected to two lakes and the multiplier is 2x, the land will have a 4x multiplier
- The mountain multiplier - All lands connected to a mountain will have its value and profit multiplied by this factor - multipliers are cumulative even between lakes and mountains
- The loan multiplier - This is the value multiplied to your debt at the end of your play.

Also, must be visible to all players:
- The shuffled “Events” deck

No value can go below one.

The loaning phase

All players start with zero money. To start the game they need to make a loan with the bank. The loan has to be under 15c, but enough to pay the starting square. The player write down his loaning on his paper.
The player with the biggest loan begins. If two players have the biggest loans, the youngest starts. Note that the player is obligated to pay for the square he chose.
The players decide how long the game will take, an alarm clock is set to play when the time ends. The players can’t see the remaining time. All players must use a pen and a paper to track their money. ie:
15 <- had 15c                                              8 <- bank debt
10 <- bought cattle                                      7 <-paid some debt
They don’t need to show to other players they current finances until the game ends.
A players turn
	The first thing, except on the first turn, is to collect the profit. This must be done before any other action. The subsequent actions can be performed in any order and at the end of the players turn, his debt will be multiplied by the loan multiplier. The profit for each square is the value from the value table. After collecting the profit the player can:
Pay his debt to the bank or make a new loan. If the player don’t have enough to pay, he must pay what he can, and the remaining is multiplied by the loan multiplier. He can pay his debts or make a new loan at any time on his turn.
Buy/sell land - Note that if the player wants to buy or sell a land that is not connected with his own, he must pay the distance tax. On a player to player negotiation, who pays the tax is up to the players to decide. An empty land costs the price on the value table, but an owned land can be sold at any price the owner wishes. For example, a player may charge a higher price for a land with a double profit multiplier.
Seed a land - Brown squares are unseeded land, to make a profit the player must seed his land, turning it on a crop. When a land is seeded a green square replaces the brown one.
Buy cattle - A player can convert a crop square on a cattle square by buying cattle. The square ceases to be a crop, its profit is now the value in the “Cattle profit” on the value table.
Donation - A player owns his money, and can use it the way he chooses, including donating it to other players to gain political support. Any donation must pay the distance tax, being the distance the smaller distance between any of the player squares. Note that it’s a donation, so if the other accepts the donation this doesn’t mean he will respect the agreement.

At the end of the player turn, any debt left with the bank is multiplied by the loan multiplier and the turn goes to the next player to the right, and so on until it’s the first player turn again.
Each player has 3 minutes to end his turn.
Events

Every time that is the first player turn (except the first time), three event cards are drawn from the events deck, facing down. The first card is then turned up, read and after all players took action the event is triggered or not. Then the next event card is turned up and so on until all events are done. The events are added 

There are two types of event, the “vote to avoid” and the “pay to avoid”.
- Vote to avoid - If the majority of the players vote against this event, it will not be triggered. On the voting phase, the player can donate money to another player to change his vote, obeying the distance tax. In case of draw the event is triggered. After the voting the event is triggered immediately.
- Pay to avoid - If the value of this event is paid, it will not be triggered. Players can make loans to pay to avoid the event.

The events:
Vote to avoid:
- Increase lake multiplier, Decrease mountain multiplier -4 cards
- Increase mountain multiplier, Decrease lake multiplier  - 2 cards
- Increase lake multiplier and mountain, Decrease gold mine profit by 2 - 4 cards
- Increase land price, Decrease gold mine price - 1 card
- Decrease land price, Increase gold mine price - 3 cards
- Increase land profit, Decrease gold mine profit- 1 card
- Decrease land profit, Increase gold mine profit - 6 cards
- Increase seed price, Increase crop profit - 3 cards
- Decrease distance tax by two, Decrease crop ald gold mine profit - 2 cards
- Increase cattle price, Increase cattle profit - 2 cards
- Decrease cattle price, Decrease cattle profit - 2 cards triggered
- Decrease loan multiplier, Decrease cattle,crop and gold mine profit - 2 cards
- Increase loan multiplier, Increase lake and mountain multipliers - 1 cards
- Decrease loan multiplier, Decrease lake and mountain multipliers - 1 cards
- All gold mines are lost, all debts are paid, there must be at least one player with one gold mine for this to be triggered - 5 cards
- All crops are lost, gold mine profit increases 3c , there must be at least one player with one crop  for this to be triggered - 5 cards
- All cattle convert to crops , gold mine profit increases 3c , there must be at least one player with one cattle square for this to be triggered - 3 cards
- All gold mines are lost, all lands are converted to cattle, there must be at least one player with one gold mine for this to be triggered - 2 cards
- Decrease Gold profit - 5 cards
- Decrease distance tax, Decrease lake and mountain multiplier - 2 cards

Pay to avoid:
- Increase loan multiplier - Anyone can pay 10c to avoid this, the payment can come from more than one player. - 3 cards
- Cattle disease, each player must pay 2c for each of his own squares with cattle. All unpaid squares are converted back to crops but are still owned by the player.
- Government appropriation Lake - All lands connected to a lake will be taken from the owner, the owner will receive 2c per square taken, turning back to a brown square - Anyone can pay 15c to avoid this - 3 cards
- Government appropriation Mountain - All lands connected to a lake will be taken from the owner, the owner will receive 1c per square taken, turning back to a brown square - Anyone can pay 10c to avoid this - 2 cards

The game proceeds until the time is up, then the player with the biggest wealth, or the smallest debt, wins!
